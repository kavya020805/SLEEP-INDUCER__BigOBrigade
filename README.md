# SLEEP INDUCERðŸŒ™ | BigOBrigade

## Problem Statement

You are tasked with building a Sleep Inducer system to create a peaceful sleeping environment for inmates in a hostel. Here are the key requirements:

- There are N inmates in total, each with their own sleep time (randomly initialized).
- The Sleep Inducer is installed in a hostel with M sleeping dorms.
- The system notes every inmateâ€™s daily sleeping habits and starts sleep-inducing music at bedtime.
- It works for multiple inmates simultaneously.
- The music should not continue beyond p minutes after going to bed, assuming it takes that much time for every inmate to fall asleep.
- The Sleep Inducer should play music for all inmates without disturbing anyone, meaning it should not play music while someone is asleep.
- The system has to assign the correct number of inmates for each dorm before starting to operate.

### Assumptions:
1. Inmates have earphones/pods to listen with. Each pod is connected to a specific channel where only one music can be played at a time.
2. When one inmate falls asleep, his earpod deactivates and the channel is assigned to another earpod (i.e. inmate in the same room), provided that inmate is still awake.
3. The music system is centralized for a given room, with multiple dedicated channels that are assigned and released from time to time. Different music (and corresponding channels) can play in different rooms.

## Features

- Personalized Sleep Experience: The Sleep Inducer tailors the music playback to suit the preferences and sleep patterns of each individual inmate.
- Efficient Resource Allocation: By dynamically managing channel assignments, the system optimizes the use of available resources and ensures an uninterrupted sleep-inducing experience for all inmates.
- Customizable Settings: The system allows for the customization of music playlists, volume levels, and duration of playback to create an ideal sleeping environment.
- Real-time Monitoring: Sleep patterns and inmate activities are continuously monitored to adapt the music playback and optimize the sleep-inducing process.

## Instructions for Implementation

Please follow the instructions provided in the attached materials to complete the project successfully.

### Submission Requirements

1. **GitHub Repository (Private)**: Create a private GitHub repository for the project.
2. **Documentation**:
   - Provide detailed documentation explaining:
     - The algorithm used to implement the Sleep Inducer system.
     - Explanation of the chosen data structures, considering time and space complexity.
     - Example solutions, if applicable to the project.
   - Bonus: Design and solve a more challenging version of the problem.
3. **Submission**: Upload the GitHub repository link to the designated platform.
4. **Access Sharing**: Grant access to the repository to the Class TA and Instructor for evaluation.
