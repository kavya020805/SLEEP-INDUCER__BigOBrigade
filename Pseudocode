The given things that we have:
N=Number of Inmates
M=Number of Dorm
p=Time taken by the inmate to fall asleep

First of all we will take some of the following assumption related to the problem.
ASSUMPIONS:-
1)We will take the time taken by the inmate to fall asleep (i.e., p in minutes) to be the same.
2)We will have the capacity of each dorm as N/M
3)Same time sleeping time for all days will be same.




Pseudocode:-

int N,M,p;
take N and M;
Make a class Inmate with data of name , id , sleep time and p;
make array of class inmate of length N;
take input of inmates from a txt file in this array;
Mkae a class dorm with data name , set of music channel and set of music;
Take input of M dorms in an array of data type dorm class;
