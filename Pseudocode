The given things that we have:
N=Number of Inmates
M=Number of Dorm
p=Time taken by the inmate to fall asleep

First of all we will take some of the following assumption related to the problem.
ASSUMPIONS:-
1)We will take the time taken by the inmate to fall asleep (i.e., p in minutes) to be the same.
2)We will have the capacity of each dorm as N/M
3)Same time sleeping time for all days will be same.




Pseudocode:-

int N,M,p;
take N and M;
Make a class Inmate with data of name , id , sleep time and p;
make array of class inmate of length N;
take input of inmates from a txt file in this array;
Mkae a class dorm with data name , set of music channel and set of music;
Take input of M dorms in an array of data type dorm class;


Sort the inmates on the basis of their sleep times in an ascending order;
Choose the first inmate for dorm 1 then for next inmates choose the next one which has sleep time greater than "sleeptime of previous inmate + p(say 100)";
After traversal,again go back to the first remaining inmate and do the same process for dorm2.
Continue the process till all the inmates are assigned
If Number of dorms are over and yet inmates are not then output the minimum number of dorms to achieve the above task.
End
